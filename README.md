pelican-cite
==============

Allows the use of BibTeX citations within a Pelican site.

Requirements
============

`pelican-cite` requires `pybtex`.

```bash
pip install pybtex
```

How to Use
==========

This plugin reads a user-specified BibTeX file and generates bibliographic
information within your articles and pages.

Configuration is simply:

```python
PUBLICATIONS_SRC = 'content/pubs.bib'
```

If the file is present and readable, then content will be scanned for references
to citation keys. These take the format `[@Bai2011]` or `[@@Bai2011]`. These
will be replaced by incline citations which provide links to the full
bibliographic information at the end of the article. The former reference would
be replaced by a citation of the form "Bai & Stone (2011)", while the latter
would be replaced by "(Bai & Stone, 2011)".

If a citation key is used which does not exist within the BibTeX file then
a warning will be displayed.

The BibTeX file may, optionally, be provided or overridden on a per-article
basis by supplying the meta-data `publications_src`.

The bibliography will be appended to the end of the page or article unless the
liquid_tag style `{% BIBLIOGRAPHY %}` is present in the text. In that case the
tag will be replaced by the bibliography.

If the `{% BIBLIOGRAPHY groupname %}` contains the additional parameter
`groupname`, all entries being associated with the group `groupname` will be
added to the bibliography.

Example: if `content/pubs.bib` contains:

```bibtex
@Article{important2017,
  â€¦
  groups  = {all, subgroup}
}
```

and an article conains `{% BIBLIOGRAPHY subgroup %}`, then `important2017` will
be added to the bibliography, no matter if it was cited somewhere else on the
page.
